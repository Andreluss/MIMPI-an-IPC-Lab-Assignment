# MIMPI: An IPC Lab Assignment

This is a project written in C, consisting of the solution code and a test script.  
**Course**: Concurrent Programming (3rd semester, 2023/2024)  
**Degree**: Bachelor's at University of Warsaw  

## About
This project is an implementation of a small, slightly modified fragment of MPI, referred to as MIMPI. It involves writing both a program that runs parallel computations and a library according to the specification provided. The original problem description can be found [here](assignment.md).

## Features
- **Parallel Computations:** The system can manage multiple computations concurrently, ensuring efficient use of resources.
- **Inter-Process Communication:** The system ensures that all processes can communicate with each other, preventing data loss or deadlock.
- **Error Handling:** The system can detect and handle errors, ensuring the consistency of the data.

## Demo
Reference the [test](test) script and [examples](https://github.com/Andreluss/MIMPI-an-IPC-Lab-Assignment/tree/master/examples) folder for more.
